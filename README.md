# Earthquake Tracker

The Earthquake Tracker is our first group project in the bootcamp. 

The requirements to succeed were the following: 

1.) Must use at least 2 server side APIs.

2.) Must not use the Bootstrap framework.

3.) The website must be interactive and respond to user input. 

4.) The website must be polished.

5.) The code must meet good quality standards.

6.) The website cannot use alerts, prompts or confirms. 

We created an interactive website to help concerned citizens see where earthquakes are happening around the globe. As a user, they can see 5 earthquakes that have occurred in the last hour. The user can also see earthquakes in a region that they select, by using the input box. 

We utilized the usgs.gov, google maps and opencage geocoding APIs to pull and display earthquake data. 

Matt W. and Joo H. designed the HTML and CSS, allowing for a clean and polished interface.
We utilized Materialize CSS, Google Font API and deployed background image from Pixabay:

Melinda I. and Kelsey J. created the earthquake, the google maps and the opencage geocoding API integrations that power the website.

In the future, we want to pull earthquakes based off the user's searched magnitude, so that citizens are informed of what's really going on underground.
